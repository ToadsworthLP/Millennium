# Millenium -  what happens if Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Unity had a child

This is a engine/game framework/whatever you like to call it I'm making for fun and to make it easier for other people to create Paper Mario: TTYD-based fangames.
I didn't really document anything, but many of the function and variable names should be pretty self-explanatory. At least that's what I hope. :^)

To use/contribute, fork this project and clone your fork to anywhere on your computer. Next open Unity, click "Add" and choose the folder you cloned Millenium in. Give it some time to load and you're good to go!

My goal with this project is to provide a relatively easy-to-use and modern alternative to programs like Star Rod. It is still fairly early in development, but it's here if you want to check it out anyways, just be aware that there can and will be changes that may break your code if it's interacting with mine!

If you need help with anything just open an issue or @ me at Twitter (@Toadsworth1507).
I also hang out on many Discord servers like the Paper Mario Fan Community discord or the Mario RPG Central if you prefer that.

Also, I obviously don't own/am affiliated with Super Mario, Paper Mario, Nintendo, Intelligent Systems, Reggie and his memes or anything else which isn't my code.
